        <div class='textBoxHead'>Hello.</div>
        <div class='textBoxBody'>My name is <t class='bold'>Andrew Clark</t>, and I am currently enrolled as a Sophomore here at the College of Charleston. I have about 4 years of experience in programming and graphic design. Over time they have both become a true passion of mine, which is what lead me to pursue a major in Computer Science and Information Systems. Although I am already experienced in javascript, in this class I am interested in pursuing it further in a more formal setting, and furthermore completing the requirements for my desired major.</div>
        <div class='textBoxFoot'>Can't wait to get started!</div>
